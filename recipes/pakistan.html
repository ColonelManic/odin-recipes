    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sweet coconut samosas, you say? Some of you may be raising your eyebrows. Never heard of them? It's OK, I understand.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 cups (270 g) plain flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon (45 g) butter</li>
        <li>Water, as much as needed to form a dough</li>
        <li>½ cup (45 g) dessicated coconut</li>
        <li>½ cup (100 g) white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin with making the pastry. In a bowl, add the butter and use your fingertips to mix the butter into the flour, until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Add water, a few tablespoon at a time. Use your hands to knead the dough until it forms a firm dough. Be very careful not to add too much water, as if the dough becomes too wet it will be too difficult to work with.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the filling, simply mix all the ingredients together until well incorporated and set aside.</li>
        <li>Take small balls out of the dough and begin to roll them out into circles, much like making a small chapatti. Cut the circles into 4 quarters.</li>
        <li>Working with each quarter, shape and fill the samosas as shown in the post until you have finished all the dough,</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep wok or pan on medium heat. Fry the samosas on medium heat, turning throughout the fry time.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
